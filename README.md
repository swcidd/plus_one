## Why +1?

Tracking your lifts shouldn't feel like homework. Most apps either bury your numbers under five layers of menus or lock them behind a subscription. +1 does one thing and does it well: **it remembers what you lifted so you can see yourself getting stronger.**

- ✍️ **Log in seconds** — exercises, sets, reps, and weight in a few taps.
- 📈 **Watch the line go up** — every lift charted against your previous sessions.
- 🏆 **Catch your PRs** — personal records surface automatically, no digging.
- 📅 **Never lose your streak** — a calendar of everything you've done.
- 🎯 **Know what's next** — each session suggests a target based on your own history.

No account required. No ads. Your workout data stays on your device.

## Tech stack

| Layer | Choice |
| --- | --- |
| Framework | Flutter |
| Language | Dart |
| State management | `provider` (`ChangeNotifier`) |
| Networking | `http` + JSON model classes |
| Charts | `fl_chart` |
| Storage | `shared_preferences` / `sqflite` |

Architecture follows a clean separation: `models/` holds plain data classes, `services/` talks to the API, `providers/` owns app state, `screens/` renders pages, and `widgets/` holds reusable UI.
